# ML_Normal_Equation
Normal Equation is an analytical approach to Linear Regression with a Least Square Cost Function. We can directly find out the value of θ without using Gradient Descent. Following this approach is an effective and a time-saving option when are working with a dataset with small features.

Normal Equation is a follows :

## In the above equation, ##
* θ : hypothesis parameters that define it the best.
* X : Input feature value of each instance.
* Y : Output value of each instance.
